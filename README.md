# Restau-Finder-via-Arduino_Mega_2560

If you have the arduino setup as per the readme instructions then it's time to compile and run the code. I strongly recommend PlatformIO for Atom text editor found [here](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ide-atom) as a universal arduino IDE because it does not require PlatformIO core, but does require Python 2.7.

If you don't want to go through all the hassle then check out a quick demo [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/LYiSm73A4XW8SN3b2).
