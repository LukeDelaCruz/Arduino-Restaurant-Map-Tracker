CMPUT 274 Fa17

Accessories:
* Adafruit ILI9341 Breakout (the touchscreen display + SD)
* Joystick
* Approximately 15 wires of varying lengths are needed

Included Files:
* complexrestaufinder.cpp [main file that was removed with 750+ lines of code!]
* lcd_image.h [removed]
* lcd_image.cpp [removed]
* mapconvert.h [removed]
* mapcovert.cpp [removed]
* sorting.h [removed]
* sorting.cpp [removed]
* Makefile [REMOVED as this won't even compile anymore]
* README

Usage instructions:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B style USB cable.
2. Ensure that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/dev/ttyACM0 or -ACM1).
3. In the directory containing the files, use commands "make upload && serial-mon"
to upload the code to the Arduino and view the serial monitor.

* How to use the rating selector:
1. Select a rating from 1-5 or no ratings at all.
	>Side note: You can cancel your choice by clicking it again and also the program forces only one choice.
	>Side note: The program allows will only highlight the rating you chose, and counts it as the minimum
							rating such that any ratings that are greater are included in the list and ratings below that
							are removed from the list.
	>Side note: The program remembers your option from mode 0 after leaving mode 1 and returning back to mode 0.
2. Move the cursor to the desired location.
3. Click the joystick to generate a unique list of restaurants sorted not only by their distance but also rating.
4. Enjoy.

Notes:
* Thanks to the lab help room people for their helpful insights.

Assumptions:
* Cursor flickers during motion
* You cannot move up and down the list of restaurants until the list has be fully made
* You cannot move the cursor until the screen has fully loaded

Extra features/implementations outside of the exercise:
* None at this time

Issues with the program:
* Not all functions were separated into different files because they hold many variables which causes many problems when linking them

Wiring instructions:
* Wiring: from bottom to top on the right side (the side with the pins).
